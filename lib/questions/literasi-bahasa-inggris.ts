    text: 'Text 1\nIt is an undeniable fact that both computers and the Internet have become one of the most important achievements of modern society. They bring their own revolution in human daily life eliminating the distances and offering immediate and easily access to information and communication. With the continuous development of new technologies, the Internet users are able to communicate anywhere in the world to shop online, use it as an educational tool, work remotely and carry out financial transactions with various services offered by banks. The infinite possibilities that are offered by the Internet can often lead users to abuse it, or to use it for malicious purposes against other users, organizations and public services.\n\nThe human being is often considered as a "social being." Therefore, it is no surprise that the Internet is continuously transformed from a simple tool for publishing information to a mean of social interaction and participation. Social networks are characterized as online services that allow individuals to create a public profile within an entrenched net system. Additionally, the users publish a list of other users with whom share a connection and view and interchange their own lists of connections and those who are created by others in the system. Social networks are a set of interactions and relationships. The term is also used today to describe websites that allow interface between users sharing reviews, photos and other information. The most famous of these websites are Facebook, Twitter, My Space, Skype, OoVoo, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, TripAdvisor. These websites are virtual communities where people can communicate and develop contacts through them.\n\nA social network is a social structure made up for a number of factors, such as individuals or organizations. On the internet, social networks are a platform that is maintained for the creation of social relations between people, usually as active members of the social network, with common interests or activities.\n\nSocial networking sites are organized sites on the web with more centered character providing in their overwhelming majority, a series of basic and free services such as creating profiles, uploading pictures and videos, commenting on actions taken by other members of the network or group, instant messaging and other more.\n\nText 2\nIt is clear that people spend a large amount of time on the internet at present, and therefore spend less time with actual people. While this use of the Internet has significantly improved the degree of contact available, I strongly believe that it has also had negative effects on the amount and form of social interaction that takes place.\n\nIn terms of enhanced connectivity, the advantages of the Internet are obvious, with people connected across the globe. In the past, it was possible to communicate only by phone or mail, which took time and cost. It also generally meant just keeping in touch with the people you already knew. This has changed drastically with the internet. Online communities that are global in scope have been created by email and social networking sites, and they have fostered contact between people and countries that we would not have considered possible in the not too distant past.\n\nThat said, in my opinion, there is no question that this has had detrimental effects on social interaction. People are spending hours of their time online, chatting, and on forums, particularly the younger generation. While this may be helpful, it is definitely not the same as actual human contact and does not require the same ability. In order to grow their own interpersonal skills, it is crucial that kids have and sustain real friendships. Not only this, if people spend much of their time talking online and not mixing in their neighbourhoods, it can also have detrimental effects on local communities and may contribute to feelings of alienation for those people who do not have a \'real\' person to turn to in times of need.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the internet has certainly been helpful, but there are legitimate reasons to worry about our societies\' social interaction. It is critical, therefore, that we maintain a balance between our online lives and our interaction with real human beings.\n\nWhat does the word "detrimental" mean in Text 2 Paragraph 3?',

With the continuous development of new technologies, the Internet users are able to communicate anywhere in the world to shop online, use it as an educational tool, work remotely and carry out financial transactions with various services offered by banks. The infinite possibilities that are offered by the Internet can often lead users to abuse it, or to use it for malicious purposes against other users, organizations and public services.\n\nThe human being is often considered as a "social being." Therefore, it is no surprise that the Internet is continuously transformed from a simple tool for publishing information to a mean of social interaction and participation. Social networks are characterized as online services that allow individuals to create a public profile within an entrenched net system. Additionally, the users publish a list of other users with whom share a connection and view and interchange their own lists of connections and those who are created by others in the system. Social networks are a set of interactions and relationships. The term is also used today to describe websites that allow interface between users sharing reviews, photos and other information. The most famous of these websites are Facebook, Twitter, My Space, Skype, OoVoo, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, TripAdvisor. These websites are virtual communities where people can communicate and develop contacts through them.\n\nA social network is a social structure made up for a number of factors, such as individuals or organizations. On the internet, social networks are a platform that is maintained for the creation of social relations between people, usually as active members of the social network, with common interests or activities.\n\nSocial networking sites are organized sites on the web with more centered character providing in their overwhelming majority, a series of basic and free services such as creating profiles, uploading pictures and videos, commenting on actions taken by other members of the network or group, instant messaging and other more.\n\nText 2\nIt is clear that people spend a large amount of time on the internet at present, and therefore spend less time with actual people. While this use of the Internet has significantly improved the degree of contact available, I strongly believe that it has also had negative effects on the amount and form of social interaction that takes place.\n\nIn terms of enhanced connectivity, the advantages of the Internet are obvious, with people connected across the globe. In the past, it was possible to communicate only by phone or mail, which took time and cost. It also generally meant just keeping in touch with the people you already knew.

Online communities that are global in scope have been created by email and social networking sites, and they have fostered contact between people and countries that we would not have considered possible in the not too distant past.\n\nThat said, in my opinion, there is no question that this has had detrimental effects on social interaction. People are spending hours of their time online, chatting, and on forums, particularly the younger generation. While this may be helpful, it is definitely not the same as actual human contact and does not require the same ability. In order to grow their own interpersonal skills, it is crucial that kids have and sustain real friendships. Not only this, if people spend much of their time talking online and not mixing in their neighbourhoods, it can also have detrimental effects on local communities and may contribute to feelings of alienation for those people who do not have a \'real\' person to turn to in times of need.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the internet has certainly been helpful, but there are legitimate reasons to worry about our societies\' social interaction.

In lab dishes and mice, the protein curbed bacterial growth. But some people have a mutated version of the protein that doesn't work as well, perhaps putting them at higher risk of becoming infected.\n\nTal and colleagues aimed to find genes that may make some people more susceptible to Lyme disease. The team analyzed genetic data from about 620,000 people who'd been seen at hospitals or primary care clinics in Finland and Estonia. More than 25,000 of those individuals had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.\n\nThe analysis uncovered three candidate genes. Two genes provide the instructions to make immune proteins that help the body identify foreign invaders. The third gene codes for SCGB1D2, \"a totally unexpected protein that ... we didn't really know anything about,\" says geneticist Hanna Ollila of the University of Helsinki. The team eventually figured out that the protein is made in sweat glands and may show up on the skin — the first line of defense against hungry ticks.\n\nIn lab dishes, the protein stopped B. burgdorferi from growing. What's more, mice injected with the protein plus the bacteria didn't become infected. However, 40 percent of people in the study carried a mutated version of the protein. In experiments with that variant, twice as much protein was required to curb bacterial growth in lab dishes. And mice injected with the variant alongside the bacteria developed infections.\n\nText 2\nLyme disease is most often caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. In the United States, this bacterium is spread by ticks that are carried by mice, deer, and other animals. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a distinctive bulls-eye rash. Most patients receive doxycycline, an antibiotic that usually clears up the infection. In some patients, however, symptoms such as fatigue, memory problems, sleep disruption, and body aches can persist for months or years.\n\nTal and Ollila, who were postdocs together at Stanford University, began this study a few years ago in hopes of finding genetic markers of susceptibility to Lyme disease. To that end, they decided to run a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a Finnish dataset that contains genome sequences for 410,000 people, along with detailed information on their medical histories.\n\nThis dataset includes about 7,000 people who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease, allowing the researchers to look for genetic variants that were more frequently found in people who had had Lyme disease, compared with those who hadn't. This analysis revealed three hits, including two found in immune molecules that had been previously linked with Lyme disease. However, their third hit was a complete surprise — a secretoglobin called SCGB1D2.\n\nSecretoglobins are a family of proteins found in tissues that line the lungs and other organs, where they play a role in immune responses to infection. The researchers discovered that this particular secretoglobin is produced primarily by cells in the sweat glands. To find out how this protein might influence Lyme disease, the researchers created normal and mutated versions of SCGB1D2 and exposed them to Borrelia burgdorferi grown in the lab. They found that the normal version of the protein significantly inhibited the growth of Borrelia burgdorferi. However, when they exposed bacteria to the mutated version, twice as much protein was required to suppress bacterial growth.\n\nThe researchers then exposed bacteria to either the normal or mutated variant of SCGB1D2 and injected them into mice. Mice injected with the bacteria exposed to the mutant protein became infected with Lyme disease, but mice injected with bacteria exposed to the normal version of SCGB1D2 did not.\n\nThe phrase \"foreign invaders\" in Text 1 Paragraph 3 can be replaced with....",
